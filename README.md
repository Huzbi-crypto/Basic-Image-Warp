# Introduction

This is a webpage that warps or distorts (I don't know what's the word) when you press the `Warp` button or when you hover your mouse on the image.

This is another project in my Creative Coding projects that I'm trying to make to improve my creative coding skills and techniques.

## Instructions on Usage

1. You can either `git clone` this repo and then open the `index.html` file to see the effect,
2. Or you can go to [this](https://huzbi-creativecoding.vercel.app/image-warp/image-warp.html) site to get the feel as well.

Both work and have no difference.

## For Future

- Add more images and the option to change them to get the distortion of various styles of images.
- Change and improve the UI to make it look modern and comfortable to visit for longer periods. (Optional)
